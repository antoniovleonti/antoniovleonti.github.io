    <h1>aleonti.dev</h1>
      <p>I'm Antonio Leonti. I live in Cambridge, MA. I am a software engineer.
      I have many hobbies and eclectic tastes.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonti/">LinkedIn</a>
      <p> I work for Google in Kendall Square in Cambridge. I work on an
      open-source proxy called Envoy. For me, this mostly entails fixing bugs
      as they're found, implementing feature requests from other teams that use
      Envoy, and importing open source contributions (and fixing the endless
      bugs that those create internally).</p>
      <p> I previously worked on a team developing extremely high-throughput
      "crypto oracle" micro services which took care of things like terminating
      TLS connections for Cloud and Google prod (i.e., Search, YouTube,
      etc.).</p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/antoniovleonti">Github</a>
      <p>Since I work on open source, you can see some of my professional
      engineering work on Github.</p>
      <p>I also sometimes enjoy coding in my freetime. I like coding
      multi-tenant game servers for turn-based multiplayer games (think
      something like chess.com). No original games yet. I do it for the
      convenience of playing online, the ability to show others the game
      without a physical copy, and of course to improve my engineering
      skills.</p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tonnes45">SoundCloud</a>
      <p>I recently started making music. I'm pretty bad at it, but I think if
      I keep trying I'll eventually be ok. I like the technical aspect of it
      and the creative outlet.</p>
